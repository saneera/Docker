Namespaces and Cgroups
======================

### Namespaces ###
 Namespaces are a linux technology that allows processes to be isolated in terms of the resources that they see.
 They can be used to prevent different processes from intefering or interacting with one another. Docker uses namespaces to 
 isolated containers. This technology allows containes to operate independently and securly.
 
 Docker uses namespaces such as the following to isolate resources for containers
 
 pid : Process isolation
 
 net: Network Interfaces
 
 ipc: Inter-process communication
 
 mnt: Filsystem mounts
 
 uts: Kernel and version identifiers
 
 user namespaces : Requires special configuration. Allows container process to run as a root inside the container while 
 mapping that user to an unprevileged user on the host

 are used by docker to enfroce rules around resource usage
