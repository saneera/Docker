#### Create the Backup ####

1. Stops the docker service

2. Back up all data in the directory /var/lib/docker/swarm.

3. start the Docker service

On the manager:
  ```
  sudo systemctl stop docker
  sudo tar -zvcf backup.tar.gz /var/lib/docker/swarm
  sudo systemctl start docker
  ```

#### Restore from Backup ####

1. Stop the docker service
2. Delete any existing files or directories under /var/lib/docker/swarm.
3. copy the baccked-up files to /var/lib/docker/swarm.
4. Start the Docker service


On the manager:
  ```
  sudo systemctl stop docker
  sudo rm -rf /var/lib/docker/swarm/*
  sudo tar -zxvf backup.tar.gz -C /var/lib/docker/swarm/
  sudo systemctl start docker
  docker node ls
  ```
