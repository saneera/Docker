Selecting a Storage Driver
========================

Storage drivers provides a pluggable framework for managing the temporary, internal storage of a container's writable layer.
Docker supports a variety of storage drivers. The best storage drivers to use depends on you environment and your storage needs

overlay1: File-based storage. Default for Ubuntu and CentOS 8+.

devicemapper: Block storage, more efficent for doing lots of writes. Defaults for CentOS 7 and earlier

 Get the current storage driver:
  ```
  docker info
  
   Storage Driver: devicemapper
   Pool Name: docker-202:1-649113-pool
   Pool Blocksize: 65.54kB
   Base Device Size: 10.74GB
   
  ```
  
  Docker automatically select a default storage driver that is compatible with your environment. However,
  in some cases you may want to override the default to use the different driver. 

  There are two ways to do this:

  1. Set the --storage-driver flag when starting Docker (in your system unit file for example)
  
     Set the storage driver explicitly by providing a flag to the Docker daemon:
     ```
     sudo vi /usr/lib/systemd/system/docker.service
     ```
     Edit the ExecStart line, adding the --storage-driver devicemapper flag:
     ```
     ExecStart=/usr/bin/dockerd --storage-driver devicemapper ...
     ```

    After any edits to the unit file, reload Systemd and restart Docker:
     ```
     sudo systemctl daemon-reload
     sudo systemctl restart docker
     ```
  
2 . Set the "storage-driver" value in /etc/docker/daemon.json (recomended way)

    We can also set the storage driver explicitly using the daemon configuration file. 
    This is the method that Docker recommends. 
    Note that we cannot do this and pass the --storage-driver flag to the daemon at the same time:
      ```
      sudo vi /etc/docker/daemon.json
      ```

     Set the storage driver in the daemon configuration file:
      ```
      {
        "storage-driver": "devicemapper"
      }
      ```

      Restart Docker after editing the file. 
       It is also a good idea to make sure Docker is running properly after changing the configuration file:

      ```
      sudo systemctl restart docker
      sudo systemctl status docker
      ```
