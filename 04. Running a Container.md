Running a Container
==================

Ready to run some containers

we can run containes using the docker run command
  ```
  docker run [OPTIONS] IMAGE[:TAG] [COMMAND] [ARG..]
  ```
  IMAGE :  The container image to run by default, these are pulled from docker hub.
  TAG: A specific image tag. Usually used to pull a speacific version.
  COMMAND: Command to run inside the container.
  ARG: Arguments to pass when running command
  
  
Run a simple container using the hello-world image:
  ```
  docker run hello-world
  ```
  
Run a container using a specific image tag:
  ```
  docker run nginx:1.15.11
  ```
Run a container with a command and arguments:
  ```
  docker run busybox echo hello world!
  ```

Run an Nginx container customized with a variety of flags:
  ```
  docker run -d --name nginx --restart unless-stopped -p 8080:80 --memory 500M --memory-reservation 256M nginx
  ```
  -d : Run container in detached mode. The docker run command will exit imediately and the container will run background.
  
  --name : A container is assigned a random name by default, but you can give it a more descriptive name with this flag
  
  --restart : Specify when the container should be automatically restarted  
     
     no(default) : Never restart the container
     
     on-failure: Only if the container fails ( exists with a non-zero exit code)
     
     always: Always restart the container whether it succeds or fails. Also start the container automatically in daemon startup.
     
     unless-stopped: Always restrt the container whether it succeseds or fails, and on daemon start up, 
                     unless the container was manually stopped


#### Manage Containers ####

List any currently running containers:
  ```
  docker ps
  ```

List all containers, both running and stopped:
  ```
  docker ps -a
  ```

Stop the Nginx container:
  ```
  docker container stop nginx
  ```

Start a stopped container:
  ```
  docker container start nginx
  ```

Delete a container (but it must be stopped first):
  ```
  docker container rm nginx
  ```
